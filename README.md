Welcome to our Flatiron Cohort Information CLI App. This application has access to information such as

- Names
- Pets
- Siblings
- Myers Briggs Personality Type
- Love Language types

The program examine trends from several responses from cohort students, in a fun way to learn a bit more about our community.

The CLI App starts with an introduction of the 16 Personalities and 5 Love Langauges, followed by a simple and easy to follow menu for navigation. Users can navigate the menu by using numeric inputs to call upon a specific action.

To download - clone the repository and run ruby bin/run.rb to initiate the CLI.

We want to thank everyone who participated in the survey.
